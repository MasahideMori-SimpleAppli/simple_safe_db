## Caution
This project is under construction and will not be available until this notice is removed.  

## Overview
"SimpleSafeDB" is an in-memory database that stores data in units of lists of classes.
This database allows you to register class structures as they are in the database,  
and allows full-text searches of the elements of the registered classes.  
In addition, queries are also classes, and can have DB operation information consisting of   
who, when, what, why, and from.  
If serialized and saved, it provides a very rich source of information for security audits and 
usage analysis.  
This is particularly useful in projects with various constraints, such as medical use.  
In addition, for when, the TemporalTrace class has a complete tracing function for   
the communication path and each arrival time.  
I think this would be useful, for example, in space-scale communication networks and relay servers,
where non-negligible delays occur even at the speed of light.

## Speed
This package is an in-memory database, so it is generally fast.  
There is usually no problem with around 100,000 records.  
I recommend that you test it in an actual environment using speed_test.dart in the test folder.  
However, since it consumes RAM capacity according to the amount of data,  
if you need an extremely large database, consider using a general database.  
For reference, below are the results of a speed test (test/speed_test.dart) run on a slightly  
older PC equipped with a Ryzen 3600 CPU.  
The test conditions were chosen to take a sufficiently long time, but I think it will rarely cause   
any problems in practical use.  

```text
speed test for 100000 records
start add
end add: 5 ms
start getAll (with object convert)
end getAll: 122 ms
returnsLength:100000
start save (with json string convert)                                                                                                                            
end save: 527 ms
start load (with json string convert)
end load: 243 ms
start search (with object convert)
end search: 333 ms

start search paging, half limit pre search (with object convert)
end search paging: 291 ms

start search paging by obj (with object convert)
end search paging by obj: 311 ms

start search paging by offset (with object convert)
end search paging by offset: 262 ms

start update at half index and last index object
end update: 35 ms
start updateOne of half index object
end updateOne: 9 ms

end conformToTemplate: 59 ms
start delete half object (with object convert)
end delete: 142 ms
returnsLength:50000
```
